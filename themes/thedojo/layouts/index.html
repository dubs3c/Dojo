    <h2>Welcome to the Dojo</h2>
    <p>The Dōjō is a playground where new cyber security professionals can practice different topics they encounter out in the real world. The playground is built using statically genereted HTML pages, thanks to Hugo. Each topic is written in markdown.</p>

    <p>There is also a web API that topics/challenges can use mount local attacks, such as padding oracles. The API can be exteended with new endpoints if a topic requires it.</p>

    <p>Nuff said, let's rumble!</p>
