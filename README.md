# Dōjō

The Dōjō is a playground for new cyber security professionals to practice different topics they might encounter in the real world. This is not an exhasutive list nor an objective list. It is highly opinionated and reflects the interests of the Dōjō's creator. The creator is not a master, but a student documenting the journey towards mastery, which may never come to pass. Even so, it is the journey that matters.

The playground is built using statically genereted HTML pages, thanks to Hugo. Each topic is written in markdown. There is also a web API that topics/challenges can use to mount remote attacks, such as padding oracles. The API can be exteended with new endpoints if a topic or challenge requires it.
